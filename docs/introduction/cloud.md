# Cloud 

At the heart of WalletConnect is a relay server that transmits encrypted payloads between wallets and dapps. Our protocol establishes a remote pairing between two apps and/or devices using a relay server to relay payloads.  You can run your own open source relay server, or use our cloud offering to get started right away.

The WalletConnect Cloud web app is available at https://cloud.walletconnect.com, and is a developer portal to manage WalletConnect services and access.

It can be used for the following services:

- Project management for generating `projectId`'s for public relay server access
- Regsitry management for creating and [registry listings](registry.md)
